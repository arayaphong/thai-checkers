## Movement of the Pion (หมาก)

**Movement Capabilities:**  
The Pion can move diagonally forward only, one square at a time, to an empty square. Unlike the Dame, a Pion cannot move backward and is limited to single-square moves. This makes the Pion's movement more restricted but still strategic.

**Direction of Movement:**  
- Player 1's Pions (starting at the top of the board) move diagonally downward (increasing row numbers).
- Player 2's Pions (starting at the bottom of the board) move diagonally upward (decreasing row numbers).
- Each Pion can choose between two diagonal directions forward (left-forward or right-forward).

## Capturing Rules of the Pion

**Capture Mechanism:**  
- When an opponent's piece is diagonally adjacent in a forward direction and there is an empty square immediately beyond it in the same direction, the Pion must capture.
- The Pion must jump over the opponent's piece and land on the empty square immediately beyond the captured piece.
- The captured piece is then removed from the board.
- Unlike the Dame, the Pion can only capture in forward diagonal directions.

**Multiple Captures:**  
- After landing from a capture, if another capture is possible in a forward diagonal direction, the Pion must continue capturing in the same turn.
- Each capture must follow the same rules: jump over an adjacent opponent's piece and land on the empty square immediately beyond.
- The chain of captures continues until no further forward diagonal captures are available.

## Important Rules

- **Mandatory Capture:** If a capture is possible, it must be taken. A Pion cannot choose to make a simple move when a capture is available.
- **Forward Only:** Pions can only move and capture in forward diagonal directions; they cannot move or capture backward.
- **Promotion:** When a Pion reaches the opponent's back row (row 7 for Player 1, row 0 for Player 2), it is immediately promoted to a Dame and gains all Dame abilities. The turn ends after promotion, even if the newly promoted Dame could potentially make captures.
- **Choice of Capture:** If multiple capture sequences exist, the player may choose which sequence to execute.

**In summary:**  
The Pion moves one square diagonally forward to empty squares and, when capturing, must jump over an adjacent opponent's piece in a forward diagonal direction, landing on the empty square immediately beyond. Multiple captures are mandatory if available, and reaching the opponent's back row results in promotion to a Dame.
